# I observed CI got stuck when the c-worksheetify-server command
# didn't run. (e.g. the Java version was too old).
#
# i.e. the `c-worksheetify-server` is on PATH, but fails to run a server.
#
# Let's cover this scenario by using a bad cworksheetify server command.


Before (set c-worksheetify-server to a command which won't work):
  let old_cworksheetify_server_command = "c-worksheetify-server"
  if exists("g:cworksheetify_server_command")
    let old_cworksheetify_server_command = g:cworksheetify_server_command
    g:cworksheetify_server_command = "false"
  else
    let g:cworksheetify_server_command = "false"
  endif

Given c (a hello world C program):
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Hello World\n");
  }

Do (:CWorksheetEvaluate, which should do nothing):
  :AssertThrows CWorksheetEvaluate\<CR>

Then (check that CWorksheetEvaluate threw the expected exception):
  AssertEqual g:vader_exception, "Vim(echoerr):unable to start c-worksheetify server!"

Expect c (the same hello world C program):
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Hello World\n");
  }

After (restore c-worksheetify-server to default command):
  let g:cworksheetify_server_command = old_cworksheetify_server_command
